Assembly-

The stem that goes into the collet is simply a 1/2" OD aluminum tube stock that is press fit into the top plate with a bit of epoxy.

The square peg at the top of the knife holder is slightly chamfered (1/32") and press fit into the bearings. The left over 'D' spaces could be filled with epoxy as a forever solution (I didn't). The bearings used were these just because I had them laying around. http://www.vxb.com/page/bearings/PROD/1-2inch/Kit7527 

There are much lower profile bearings that would change the holder geometry and make it much smaller overall diameter although this has no real bearing on function.

The 3 smaller holes in the bearing clamp are sized for a 1/4"-20 bolt.  These should be tapped.  The 2 holes on the knife blade holder are sized for 10-24 and should be tapped.  

If there are any additional questions, please email me separate from the original email.  All of these emails are part of one large thread and it is very likely that I will miss it if you reply to the 'Beer Money' emai.

Have fun!
